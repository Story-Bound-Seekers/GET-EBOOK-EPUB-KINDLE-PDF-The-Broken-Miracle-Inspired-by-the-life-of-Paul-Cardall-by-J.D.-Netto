Title: Good but....
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2022
Review: I have followed Paul Carroll's journey in his blog for years. I don't remember how I found it but his blog posts are always inspiring. They were very personal and raw. Be didn't hold back, or so if seemed to me. And I stopped reading when my life became overwhelming. So this book was very confusing to me. I know it's not supposed to be a biography, but maybe I was going for one. I guess I was must confused when Paul's name stayed the same but they changed his wife's name and even the gender of his child (so child's name changed then, too). I just wish they had chosen to write a biographical piece than a "loose retelling" of events from Paul's life. I kinda wish Paul would write it as I enjoyed his blog so much and was always eager to read new posts. I mean...this book doesn't even get to the actual heart transplant or their second child. I know there is a Part 2 available, but I didn't enjoy this one enjoy to buy a second. So it was good but too far from the real story I don't know what to believe.

Review: ‚ÄúThe misfit will always be judged until understood.‚Äù Jonahs Cardall

A couple of days ago I received my copy of the The Broken Miracle-Part One. It is so good I finished it in one sitting.

Author, J.D. Netto weaves a captivating story based on real life events and journals of a young Paul Cardall who was born with only half a heart. Set in Salt Lake City, Netto takes his readers on a emotional, sometimes tear-jerking ride through Paul‚Äôs early life with multiple surgeries and struggles living with serious health challenges. With the support of his faith-filled loving parents, siblings, and community young Paul excels at the piano with his broken heart he named Tom Sawyer and begins healing other weary souls with his beautiful music...

Bravo!!! I‚Äôm looking forward to reading Part 2 of The Broken Miracle.

Title: Single sound on the keyboard of life
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2021
Review: I know this man. I know this story as I worked with his wife. Paul Cardall is a pianist who was born with half a heart. This book is laced with an undying faith in the power of prayers and the knowledge of the life saving gift given to us by Jesus Christ. Reading through the family dynamics brought so much more meaning to Paul‚Äôs music. The only thing I didn‚Äôt know, and always wondered, was why the single sound on the keyboard of his piano...the sound of Sawyer, his beating heart.

Title: Powerful story that is sure inspire anyone!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2021
Review: I had the privilege of reading Paul's book and of interviewing Paul on my miracle podcast. His story is truly one of the most compelling that I have heard. Paul is truly a living miracle and a testament that anything is possible with God. The book is well written and I cannot wait for part 2. His story is movie worthy. Paul has not only defied the odds, but he has leaned into his divine gift of music, which is touching and soothing the hearts of billions of people. The music that accompanies the project is also beautiful, so don't miss it! Knowing the story and hearing the music brings it to life that much more. Excellent piece of work!

Review: I'm obsessed especially being a heart mom of a heart warrior who also has half a heart. Paul Cardall's story is one of HOPE!! J.D. Netto kept me reading for two days! I'm looking forward to the second book. You won't regret as you'll gain so much insight on how to move past your adversities with grace. God bless Paul and J.D. Netto for sharing this incredible story.
